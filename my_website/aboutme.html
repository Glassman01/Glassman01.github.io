    <p> My name is Collin Archer, I attend Coronado High school. I am in the graduate class of 2021 and participate in N.J.R.O.T.C. I have four dogs and love math. </p>
    <p> My goals for next year are to be a team commander in my ROTC unit. I also want to have better grades than I have had this year. We are getting a new dog and I am hoping to train it.</p>
